# Few-shot learning for fast scene adaptation of crowd counting models.
My project is about scene adaptation using few-shot learning in the context of crowd counting. The basic idea is to train a model that is able to adapt to a novel scene with very few (1 to 5, or even 0!) annotated training examples of that scene. As such, we as the Municipality are no longer required to annotate large amounts of training examples whenever we place a new camera.


More information will follow once available.



If applicable, you can also show an example of the final output.

## Project Folder Structure

Explain a little bit what's where so people can find their way around. For exampole:

There are the following folders in the structure:

1) [`resources`](./resources): Random nice resources, e.g. [`useful links`](./resources/links.md)
1) [`src`](./src): Folder for all source files specific to this project
1) [`media`](./media): Folder containing media files (icons, video)
1) ...

## Usage

Explain example usage, possible arguments, etc. E.g.:

To train... 


```
$ python train.py --some-importang-argument
```
