# DEATH to CNNs

The field of computer vision received a wild contribution from researches at Facebook, whom succeeded in training a fully transformer based architecture (DeiT) to do image classification on ImageNet. In this repository, I build upon their findings by adjusting their architecture to perform regression in the context of crowd counting. That is, I transform the embedding vectors from DeiT such that a density map can be constructed. Learning is then performed as usual. I can highly recommend [this](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.12877) read.

Apart from a potential groundbreaking paper, the reptilian overlords of Facebook also blessed us peasants with several variants of their DeiT architecture, including the weights of the trained models and all code to evaluate and train the models. Hence, just like CSRNet and almost all architecures in crowd counting, we have a solid model that can be regarded as a 'general feature extractor'. Fine-tuning the weights of the model to do crowd counting can now be done in a day!

Current work focusses on simply making a solid code-base from which we can expand upon. Furthermore, since this is the first work to do regression in this way with transformers, I will perform extensive experiments to find what modifications work and which dont. Afterwards, I will use this architecture as a baseline in my persuit of a 'general' model that can quickly adapt to novel scenes it has never seen before. For this, I plan to implement and test three so called '[meta-learning](https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/2018/11/30/meta-learning.html)' algorithms: 1) [MAML](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.03400), 2) [Meta-SGD](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.09835), and 3) [reptile](https://openai.com/blog/reptile/)
